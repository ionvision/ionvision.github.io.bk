>Following is my recommendation of reading list for beginners in Computer Vision area.

###General Tutorials:

- [Computer Vision: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/CV2E-site/cv2eindex.html), by David A. Forsyth.

>*Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications* by Richard Szeliski is a good manual for reference but seems too fragmental thus not appropriate for beginners.

- [Digital Image Processing, 3rd Edition](http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIP-3E/dip3e_main_page.htm), by Rafael C. Gonzalez.

<br>

###Application Tutorials:

- [Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB, 2nd edition](http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIPUM-2E/dipum2e_main_page.htm), by Rafael C. Gonzalez.

- [OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook](http://www.laganiere.name/opencvCookbook/), by Robert Laganiere.

> You might also be interested in *Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects*, by Daniel Baggio, if you want to build some fancy projects based on Android, iOS and Microsoft Kinect.

<br>

###Math Review:

- [Linear Algebra](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/), by Jim Hefferon.


- [Probability and Stochastic Processes](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000391.html), by Roy D. Yates.

<br>

###MOOC on Coursera:

- [Image and video processing](https://class.coursera.org/images-002), by Guillermo Sapiro.

>Beginner friendly


- [Machine Learning](https://class.coursera.org/ml-005), by Andrew Ng.

>Great course, strongly recommend
