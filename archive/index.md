I am a researcher in [Media Lab](http://media-lab.ccny.cuny.edu) of [The City College](http://www.ccny.cuny.edu), [City University of New York](http://cuny.edu).  I am finishing a Ph.D. advised by Prof. [Yingli Tian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aAWeB4wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the intersection of Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Image Processing.
Currently my research interests mainly focus on inference and learning for scene text detection and recognition in the wild, and visual-linguistic understanding on scene text Images,.
My thesis proposal slides is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4dlcuqwt3vml3x/2nd.Exam.Xuejian.Rong.4.28.17.slides.pdf?dl=0). My publications are available below and on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lhAJNwkAAAAJ&hl=en) page.
Before joining Media Lab, I obtained the B.E. degree from [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://iao.nuaa.edu.cn/) in 2013. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xuejianrong/)
