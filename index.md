I am Xuejian Rong, a PhD candidate in [Media Lab](http://media-lab.engr.ccny.cuny.edu) of [The City College](http://www.ccny.cuny.edu), [City University of New York](http://cuny.edu). I am working with [Prof. Yingli Tian](http://www-ee.ccny.cuny.edu/www/web/yltian/home.html) in the area of `Machine Learning` and `Computational Photography`, especially on deblurring, denoising and enhancement algorithms.

From everyday snapshots to scientific imaging area, photographs are inevitably affected by different kinds of errors, including motion blur, out-of-focus blur and noise. These errors could be well removed with prior knowledge of the typical image data and the type of corruption.

I'm interested in extracting and modeling those prior knowledge using machine learning methods.
