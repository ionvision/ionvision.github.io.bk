For now I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Media Lab](http://media-lab.ccny.cuny.edu) of [The City College](http://www.ccny.cuny.edu), [City University of New York](http://cuny.edu), and working with Prof. [Yingli Tian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aAWeB4wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the intersection of Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Image Processing. Before joining Media Lab, I obtained the B.E. degree from [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://iao.nuaa.edu.cn/) in 2013.

Currently my research interests mainly focus on inference and learning for scene text detection and recognition in the wild, in the presence of image degradations like blur, distortion, noise, etc.
