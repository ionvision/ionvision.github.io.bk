For now I am a third year PhD candidate in [Media Lab](http://media-lab.engr.ccny.cuny.edu) of [The City College](http://www.ccny.cuny.edu), [CUNY](http://cuny.edu), and working with [Prof. Yingli Tian](http://www-ee.ccny.cuny.edu/www/web/yltian/home.html) in the intersection of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Before joining Media Lab, I obtained my BEng degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2013. 

Currently my research interests mainly focus on inference and learning for scene text detection and recognition in the wild, in the presence of image degradations like blur, distortion, and noise.
