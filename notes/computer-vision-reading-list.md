>Here's my recommendation of reading list for beginners in Computer Vision area.

##General Tutorials:

- [Computer Vision:  Models, Learning, and Inference](http://www.computervisionmodels.com/), ([Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Vision-Models-Learning-Inference/dp/1107011795/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1334662414&sr=1-1)), by Simon J.D. Prince.

> Great tutorial for beginners in CV area. The author provides free pdf file and all the algorithms with elegent matlab implementations on his website. You can even find a lot of slides and faq on it. Enjoy!

>**Computer Vision: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition** by David A. Forsyth is also excellent but seems relatively advanced.

>**Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications** by Richard Szeliski is a good manual for reference but seems too fragmental thus not appropriate for beginners.

- [Digital Image Processing, 3rd Edition](http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIP-3E/dip3e_main_page.htm), by Rafael C. Gonzalez.

>Classical textbook from which you could learn more about the image pre-processing for computer vision.

<br>

##Application Tutorials:

- [Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB, 2nd edition](http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIPUM-2E/dipum2e_main_page.htm), by Rafael C. Gonzalez.

- [OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook](http://www.laganiere.name/opencvCookbook/), by Robert Laganiere.

> You might also be interested in *Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects*, by Daniel Baggio, if you want to build some fancy projects based on Android, iOS and Microsoft Kinect.

##Math Review:

- [Linear Algebra](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/), by Jim Hefferon.

- [Probability and Stochastic Processes](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000391.html), by Roy D. Yates.

<br>

##MOOC on Coursera:

- [Image and video processing](https://class.coursera.org/images-002), by Guillermo Sapiro.

>Beginner friendly


- [Machine Learning](https://class.coursera.org/ml-005), by Andrew Ng.

>Great course, strongly recommend
